## 🎯 Overview

**Gebral** is an agentic AI-powered dashboard built to empower Dubai’s real estate decision-makers with tailored, proactive, and explainable intelligence. Unlike traditional dashboards that merely *report*, Gebral **reasons, recommends, and reacts** – turning data noise into sharp, actionable insights.

We serve three real-world personas across the value chain:

- 🧠 **Robert** *(Portfolio Investor)* – Seeking undervalued properties with ROI growth potential  
- 📦 **Amina** *(Property Manager)* – Optimizing occupancy and pricing across 100+ units  
- 📊 **Faisal** *(Developer CFO)* – Modeling financial feasibility and regulatory fit for new projects
